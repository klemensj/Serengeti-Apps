Serengeti_cont_by_species - species divided by grazers, predators, other. Boxplot with 9 options for continuous variables

Serengeti_species_pairs - specify two species and two date ranges; relative number of observations at each location shown as circle size on the camera grid


Snapshot_data - shows first two hundred lines of the dataset

Snapshot1 - overall data distribution, tabbed, distribution of observations by species, camera, and location

Snapshot2 - combined graph, revised and split into Serengeti_activity_time, Serengeti_cont_by_species, and Serengeti_species_pairs


Wildebeest1 - Wildebeest specific box plot comparison of six continuous variables between wet and dry seasons

Wildebeest2 - Static graph of wildebeest distribution at two time points


## Deployment

 Gala "Part 2 - Testing a Hypothesis": Snapshot_data, Wildebeest1, Wildebeest2
 
 Gala "Part 3 - Visualizing Serengeti Data": Snapshot1, Serengeti_cont_by_species, Serengeti_activity_time, Serengeti_species_pairs
